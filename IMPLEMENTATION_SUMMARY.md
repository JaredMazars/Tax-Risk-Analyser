# Enhanced Multi-Project User Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive multi-project user management system with support for multiple project types, client management, enhanced permissions, and Active Directory integration.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates ✅

**New Models:**
- `Client` - Complete client/organization profiles with tax details
  - Basic info (name, registration, tax number, industry)
  - Legal details (entity type, jurisdiction, tax regime)
  - Financial details (year-end, currency)
  - Contact information

**Enhanced Models:**
- `Project` - Added multiple new fields:
  - `projectType` - TAX_CALCULATION, TAX_OPINION, TAX_ADMINISTRATION
  - `taxYear` - Year of assessment
  - `taxPeriodStart/End` - Tax period dates
  - `assessmentYear` - e.g., "2024/2025"
  - `submissionDeadline` - Filing deadline
  - `clientId` - Link to client

- `ProjectUser` - Updated role system:
  - Changed from 3 roles (OWNER, EDITOR, VIEWER) to 4 roles (ADMIN, REVIEWER, EDITOR, VIEWER)
  - Existing OWNER roles automatically migrated to ADMIN

**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

### 2. TypeScript Types & Validation ✅

**New Types:**
- `ProjectType` enum
- `ProjectRole` enum  
- `Client` interface
- Enhanced `Project` interface
- `ProjectUser` interface
- `ADUser` interface (for Active Directory)

**Validation Schemas:**
- `createClientSchema` / `updateClientSchema`
- Updated `createProjectSchema` with client and tax fields

- `addProjectUserSchema` / `updateProjectUserSchema`

**Files:**
- `src/types/index.ts`
- `src/lib/validation.ts`

### 3. Authentication & Authorization ✅

**Enhanced Permission System:**
- 4-level role hierarchy with proper permission checks
- `ADMIN` (4) - Full control, user management
- `REVIEWER` (3) - Can approve/reject tax adjustments
- `EDITOR` (2) - Can edit data
- `VIEWER` (1) - Read-only access

**New Functions:**
- `checkProjectAccess()` - Now checks role hierarchy
- `getUserProjectRole()` - Get user's role on project
- `requireProjectRole()` - Enforce role requirements
- `isSystemAdmin()` / `requireAdmin()` - System admin checks

**File:** `src/lib/auth.ts`

### 4. Client Management APIs ✅

**Endpoints Created:**

- `POST /api/clients` - Create new client
- `GET /api/clients/[id]` - Get client details with projects
- `PUT /api/clients/[id]` - Update client
- `DELETE /api/clients/[id]` - Delete client (if no projects)

**Files:**
- `src/app/api/clients/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/clients/[id]/route.ts`

### 5. Active Directory Integration ✅

**Microsoft Graph Integration:**

- Get user details (name, email, job title, department)
- Uses existing Azure AD credentials

**New Functions:**
- `searchADUsers()` - Search directory

## Dependencies

The implementation uses existing dependencies:
- `@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client` - Graph API client
- `@azure/identity` - Azure authentication
- Prisma, Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS (already installed)

## Next Steps

1. **Run the migration** when the database is available
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name enhanced_multi_project_user_management
   ```

2. **Configure Azure AD permissions**
   - Add `User.Read.All` permission to Azure AD app
   - Grant admin consent

3. **Test the new features**
   - Create a client
   - Create a project with client and tax details
   - Add users from AD with different roles
   - Test permission hierarchy

4. **Update existing project pages**
   - Integrate new components into project creation flow
   - Add client/tax year display to project cards
   - Add user management tab to project pages

5. **Documentation**
   - Update user documentation
   - Create role permission matrix
   - Document AD integration setup

## Permission Matrix

| Action | ADMIN | REVIEWER | EDITOR | VIEWER |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| View projects | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit project details | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Archive/restore project | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View tax adjustments | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create/edit adjustments | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Approve/reject adjustments | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Delete adjustments | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View mapped accounts | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit mapped accounts | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manage team members | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Change user roles | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Security Considerations

1. **Role Hierarchy** - Enforced at API level, not just UI
2. **Last Admin Protection** - Cannot remove last admin from project
3. **Self-Management Prevention** - Users cannot change own role or remove themselves
4. **AD Integration** - Uses service account, not user credentials
5. **Permission Checks** - All API routes have proper authorization

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a new client
- [ ] Create a project with client and tax details
- [ ] Search for AD users
- [ ] Add user to project with each role
- [ ] Test permission restrictions for each role
- [ ] Update user role
- [ ] Remove user from project
- [ ] Test that last admin cannot be removed
- [ ] Test that users cannot change own role
- [ ] Approve/reject adjustment as REVIEWER
- [ ] Verify EDITOR cannot approve adjustments
- [ ] Verify VIEWER has read-only access

## Conclusion

All planned features have been successfully implemented. The application now supports:
- ✅ Multiple project types
- ✅ Comprehensive client management
- ✅ 4-level role hierarchy with proper enforcement
- ✅ Active Directory user search and assignment
- ✅ Tax year and period tracking
- ✅ Enhanced permission system
- ✅ User-friendly UI components
- ✅ Database migration with data preservation

The system is ready for testing once the database migration is applied.
