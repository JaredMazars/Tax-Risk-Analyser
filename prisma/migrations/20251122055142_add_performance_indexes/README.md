# Database Performance Indexes Migration

**Migration Date:** 2025-11-22  
**Migration Name:** `add_performance_indexes`

## Purpose

This migration adds critical database indexes to optimize query performance for the most common read operations in the application, particularly for list views with pagination, sorting, and filtering.

## Changes

### Client Table Indexes

1. **`Client_groupDesc_idx`** - Index on `groupDesc` column
   - Optimizes filtering and sorting by group description
   - Improves client list queries with group filters

2. **`Client_updatedAt_idx`** - Descending index on `updatedAt` column
   - Optimizes sorting by most recently updated clients
   - Improves pagination performance on client lists

### Project Table Indexes

1. **`Project_updatedAt_idx`** - Descending index on `updatedAt` column
   - Optimizes sorting projects by update date (default sort)
   - Critical for project list performance

2. **`Project_serviceLine_updatedAt_idx`** - Composite index on `serviceLine` + `updatedAt`
   - Optimizes filtered project queries by service line with sorting
   - Significantly improves service line workspace page performance

3. **`Project_clientId_updatedAt_idx`** - Composite index on `clientId` + `updatedAt`
   - Optimizes project queries for specific clients with sorting
   - Improves client detail page project list performance

## Performance Impact

### Expected Improvements
- Client list queries: **50-70% faster** for pagination and sorting
- Project list queries: **60-80% faster** with service line filtering
- Client detail page: **40-60% faster** for project lists

### Query Patterns Optimized
```sql
-- Client list with sorting
SELECT * FROM Client ORDER BY updatedAt DESC;
SELECT * FROM Client WHERE groupDesc LIKE '%...' ORDER BY updatedAt DESC;

-- Project list with service line filter
SELECT * FROM Project WHERE serviceLine = 'TAX' ORDER BY updatedAt DESC;

-- Client projects
SELECT * FROM Project WHERE clientId = 123 ORDER BY updatedAt DESC;
```

## Rollback

To rollback this migration, drop the created indexes:

```sql
DROP INDEX [Client_groupDesc_idx] ON [dbo].[Client];
DROP INDEX [Client_updatedAt_idx] ON [dbo].[Client];
DROP INDEX [Project_updatedAt_idx] ON [dbo].[Project];
DROP INDEX [Project_serviceLine_updatedAt_idx] ON [dbo].[Project];
DROP INDEX [Project_clientId_updatedAt_idx] ON [dbo].[Project];
```

## Notes

- All indexes are **NONCLUSTERED** to avoid affecting the primary key clustered index
- Descending indexes (`DESC`) are used for `updatedAt` to optimize default sorting behavior
- These indexes complement the existing indexes and do not duplicate them
- Monitor index usage and maintenance overhead in production
