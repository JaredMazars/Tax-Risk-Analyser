## Key Improvements

### 1. Concurrent Review Support
- Multiple reviewers can work simultaneously on different domains
- No merge conflicts (independent files)
- Clear domain ownership

### 2. Progress Tracking
- Domain-level sign-off provides clear milestones
- Master index shows progress at-a-glance
- Subsection tracking enables granular monitoring

### 3. Maintainability
- Smaller files (200-600 lines vs 3,000 lines)
- Easier navigation and search
- Standards centralized (update once)

### 4. Scalability
- Add new routes to appropriate domain
- Domain structure matches application architecture
- Clear patterns for new reviewers

---

## Remaining Work

### Immediate (3-4 routes)
1. **Utility Domain**: 2 document vault routes pending
2. **Service Line Domain**: 1 user-accessible-groups route pending
3. **Admin Domain**: 1 template migration route (not implemented yet)

### Primary Focus (90 routes)
**Task Routes Domain** - Not started, highest priority
- 30 newly discovered routes (December 2024)
- Critical security issues identified
- Estimated effort: 55-72 hours (3-4 weeks)

**Review Phases**:
1. Week 1: Critical security review (acceptance, tax/compliance, documents)
2. Week 2: Core operations (list, details, team, stage)
3. Week 3: Financial & specialized routes
4. Week 4: Testing & final sign-off

## Usage Guide

### For Reviewers

**Starting a Review**:
1. Open `ROUTE_REVIEW_INDEX.md` to see overall progress
2. Select a domain with pending work
3. Open the domain file (e.g., `docs/route-reviews/TASK_ROUTES.md`)
4. Review subsection-by-subsection
5. Check boxes and document findings
6. Sign off when subsection/domain complete
7. Update master index

**Review Standards**:
- Always consult `docs/route-reviews/ROUTE_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md` for checklists
- Apply all applicable checklists per route
- Document all issues found
- Document all fixes applied
- Test after changes

### For Maintainers

**Adding New Routes**:
1. Identify appropriate domain
2. Open domain file
3. Add to appropriate subsection
4. Follow existing format
5. Update route count in file header
6. Update master index totals

**Updating Standards**:
1. Edit `docs/route-reviews/ROUTE_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md`
2. Changes apply to all future reviews
3. No need to update domain files

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- Domain-based split aligns with application architecture
- Preserving all review history maintained continuity
- Master index provides clear overview
- Centralized standards prevent duplication

### Challenges Encountered
- Original checklist had inconsistent route counts
- Some routes were listed multiple times
- Utility routes needed recategorization
- Large domains (Admin, Task) required careful structuring

### Recommendations
- Continue domain-based structure for new routes
- Review task routes domain as highest priority
- Consider automated route discovery
- Implement CI/CD checks for route compliance

## Conclusion

Route review checklist successfully migrated from monolithic file to structured domain-based system. All review data preserved, file structure optimized, and foundation established for concurrent reviews and systematic progress tracking.

**Next Critical Action**: Begin Task Routes domain review (90 routes, 0% complete)
