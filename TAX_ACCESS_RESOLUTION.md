# TAX Service Line Access Resolution

## Issue Report
**User:** walter.taxadmin@MazarsInAfrica.onmicrosoft.com (Walter Tax Admin)  
**Problem:** Access denied when trying to access TAX service line pages  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Configuration is correct

---

## Investigation Summary

### 1. User Configuration (✅ CORRECT)
- **User ID:** `b351f87a-438d-4a43-8a87-65238c5e575d.c98c02b7-1480-4cf2-bf51-c12fdf55a9f8`
- **System Role:** USER
- **Service Line Role:** PARTNER
- **Assignments:** 
  - TCM (Tax Compliance) - PARTNER role
  - TCN (Tax Consulting) - PARTNER role
- **Assignment Type:** MAIN_SERVICE_LINE

### 2. Database Mappings (✅ CORRECT)
The `ServiceLineExternal` table correctly maps:
- **TCM** → TAX (masterCode)
- **TCN** → TAX (masterCode)

User's subServiceLineGroup assignments match the TAX service line requirements.

### 3. Authorization Tests (✅ ALL PASSED)
Programmatic verification confirmed access to all TAX pages:
- ✅ `/dashboard/TAX` - FULL access
- ✅ `/dashboard/TAX/TCM` - FULL access  
- ✅ `/dashboard/TAX/TCN` - FULL access
- ✅ `/dashboard/TAX/TCM/clients` - FULL access
- ✅ `/dashboard/TAX/TCN/clients` - FULL access
- ✅ `/dashboard/TAX/TCM/analytics` - FULL access
- ✅ `/dashboard/TAX/bd` - FULL access

### 4. Cache Status (✅ NO ISSUES)
- Redis is not configured (using in-memory cache)
- No persistent cache blocking access
- No database permission overrides found

---

## Root Cause
The access denial is **NOT a configuration issue**. The backend authorization is working correctly. The issue is likely:

1. **Stale browser session** - User's browser has an old session before the service line assignment was made
2. **Browser cache** - Cached permission responses or page data
3. **Session token** - Expired or invalid session token

---

## Resolution Steps

### For the User (walter.taxadmin@MazarsInAfrica.onmicrosoft.com):

1. **Log out completely**
   - Click your profile menu
   - Select "Sign Out"
   - Wait for confirmation

2. **Clear browser data**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
   - Select "All time" or "Everything"
   - Check: Cookies and Cached images/files
   - Click "Clear data"

3. **Close ALL browser tabs**
   - Including the logout confirmation tab
   - Completely close the browser application

4. **Restart browser and log back in**
   - Open a fresh browser window
   - Navigate to the application
   - Log in with Azure AD
   - Try accessing `/dashboard/TAX` pages

5. **If still blocked, try Incognito/Private mode**
   - This will bypass all browser cache
   - If it works in incognito, the issue is definitely browser cache

## Technical Details

### Service Line Access Flow
```
User Login 
  → Session Created
  → User ID: b351f87a-...
  
Page Request: /dashboard/TAX/TCM/clients
  → Extract service line: "TAX"
  → Get user assignments from ServiceLineUser
  → User has: TCM, TCN
  → Query ServiceLineExternal for masterCode = "TAX"
  → Found: TCM, TCN
  → Match: ✅ User has TCM and/or TCN
  → Get highest role: PARTNER
  → Check page permissions: PARTNER → FULL access
  → Result: Access GRANTED
```

### Database Verification
```sql
-- User assignments (confirmed)
SELECT subServiceLineGroup, role FROM ServiceLineUser 
WHERE userId = 'b351f87a-438d-4a43-8a87-65238c5e575d.c98c02b7-1480-4cf2-bf51-c12fdf55a9f8';
-- Results: TCM (PARTNER), TCN (PARTNER)

-- TAX mappings (confirmed)
SELECT SubServlineGroupCode FROM ServiceLineExternal WHERE masterCode = 'TAX';
-- Results: TCM, TCN

-- Match status: ✅ VALID
```

## Diagnostic Scripts Created

Three diagnostic scripts were created in `/scripts/`:

1. **diagnose-tax-access.ts**
   - Comprehensive diagnostic of service line assignments
   - Validates user-to-service-line mappings
   - Identifies configuration issues

2. **fix-tax-access.ts**
   - Clears cached permissions (when Redis is configured)
   - Checks for blocking database overrides
   - Provides fix recommendations

3. **verify-tax-access.ts**
   - Programmatically tests page access
   - Validates authorization flow
   - Confirms access to specific pages

To run any script:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/[script-name].ts
```

## Prevention

To avoid this issue in the future:

1. **Assign users BEFORE they first log in**
   - Prevents stale session issues
   - User gets correct permissions from first login

2. **Inform users to logout/login after role changes**
   - Include in onboarding documentation
   - Add notification when roles are updated

3. **Consider implementing automatic session refresh**
   - Detect permission changes
   - Force re-authentication
   - Update session claims

4. **Monitor access denied errors**
   - Log detailed diagnostics
   - Include user ID, page, and reason
   - Set up alerts for repeated denials

---

## Conclusion

✅ **The Walter Tax Admin user is correctly configured with PARTNER access to the TAX service line.**

✅ **All TAX pages are programmatically accessible with FULL access level.**

✅ **The user needs to clear their browser session/cache and log back in to resolve the access denied error.**

If the issue persists after following the resolution steps, check:
- Browser console for JavaScript errors
- Network tab for failed API calls (401/403 responses)
- Application logs for "Page access denied" messages
