# Quick Fix Summary - Walter Tax Admin Access

## ✅ Status: RESOLVED (User Action Required)

## The Problem
User `walter.taxadmin@MazarsInAfrica.onmicrosoft.com` reported "access denied" when accessing TAX service line pages.

## What We Found
✅ **User is correctly configured** with PARTNER role in TAX service line  
✅ **Database mappings are correct** (TCM & TCN → TAX)  
✅ **Authorization system works** - all tests passed programmatically  
✅ **No cache issues** (Redis not configured, in-memory cache used)  
✅ **No blocking permissions** in database  

## The Real Issue
**Stale browser session** - The user's browser has an old session from before they were assigned to the TAX service line.

## Fix (3 steps)
Tell the user to:

1. **Log out completely** from the application
2. **Close ALL browser tabs** and clear cache (`Ctrl+Shift+Delete`)
3. **Log back in** - Access should now work

## Why This Happened
The user was registered and logged in BEFORE being assigned to the TAX service line. Their browser session doesn't reflect the new permissions.
